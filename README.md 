# AI Agents
A collection of patterns for experimenting with agents, llm pipelines, and ChainOfThoughtStrategy. 
Heavily inspired by examples and code across the AI Open Source community but with some fearnworks patterns heavily interspersed. 

## UI
Front end for templates currently uses streamlit, however display for each agent example will be heavily decoupled from deployment avenue. 
Strategies for jupyter, streamlit, and react will be prioritized in general at this time. 

## Modules
