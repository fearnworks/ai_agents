    KnowledgeDomain Class

    Design:
    This class acts as a base for knowledge domain classes. It's not intended to be instantiated directly, 
    but should be extended by other classes that provide a specific implementation for the generate_response method. 
    This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) by providing a base 
    class that can be extended without modification.

    Intended Implementation:
    Classes that extend KnowledgeDomain should provide an implementation for the generate_response method. 
    The generate_response method should take a question string as input and return a response string. The 
    specifics of how the response is generated will depend on the requirements of the subclass.
